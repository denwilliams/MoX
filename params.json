I have all my music on XBMC but find the on-screen GUI too slow and limited when trying to find something to play, so I tend to pull up the web interface and select my music there. The only problem there is the default web interface is _incredibly_ slow. Painfully so when running XBMC on a Raspberry Pi.\r\n\r\nThere are lots of great \"mobile-focused\" web interfaces out there, but not a great deal of desktop focused ones out there. I really don't see the need for a mobile web interface though with so many great iOS & Android apps out there! \r\n\r\nThe only functional desktop web UI I've used is AWXi, but the hole experience with using that thing feels awkward and dated. I really wanted something with a more modern & clean feel to it, but wasn't finding anything... so I decided to build my own.\r\n\r\nThe whole approach with MoX is to focus on the \"modern\", as such only v12 (Frodo) and above will be supported. In addition only modern browsers will be supported - I don't want to hold back on capabilities just so someone can use IE7.\r\n\r\nMoX uses a number of HTML5 features to make the experience as good as possible:\r\n1. LocalStorage and SessionStorage are used where available for caching server queries. This results in a **significant** reduction in time for common queries - even after closing & reopening the browser. If not enabled then queries are cached in memory so performance is still improved \r\n2. Web Sockets are used for the JSON-RPC communications where available. In addition to lower overhead for RPC calls, 2-way communication allows for instant notification of events and uber-quick feeback to the Web UI. There is also a fallback to HTTP RPC calls. \r\n\r\nFuture versions will also incorporate:\r\n1. Responsive design so it will work great on tablets and phones too\r\n2. Playing media directly in the browser using HTML5 on supported browsers (death to Flash!)\r\n\r\n### Authors and Contributors\r\nWritten by Den Williams (@denwilliams)\r\n\r\nThe XBMC controller classes have been separated into another project called XbmcControllerJs(http://denwilliams.github.io/XbmcControllerJs/) in the hope that it will assist others in creating more functional Web UIs. Please feel free to use that in whatever project you like.\r\n\r\nUtilising a number of AWESOME projects out there:\r\n1. Knockout\r\n2. Bootstrap\r\n3. jQuery\r\n4. Modernizr\r\n5.
