<h3>About MoX</h3>

<p>I love XBMC - I have an installation of it in every room in my house - but I've never been that fussed with any of the web interfaces. I have all my music on XBMC but find the on-screen GUI too slow and limited when trying to find something to play, so I tend to pull up the web interface and select my music there. The only problem there is the default web interface is <em>incredibly</em> slow. Painfully so when running XBMC on a Raspberry Pi.</p>

<p>There are lots of great "mobile-focused" web interfaces out there, but not a great deal of desktop focused ones out there. I really don't see the need for a mobile web interface though with so many great iOS &amp; Android apps out there! </p>

<p>The only functional desktop web UI I've used is AWXi, but the hole experience with using that thing feels awkward and dated. I really wanted something with a more modern &amp; clean feel to it, but wasn't finding anything... so I decided to build my own.</p>

<p>The whole approach with MoX is to focus on the "modern", as such only v12 (Frodo) and above will be supported. In addition only modern browsers will be supported - I don't want to hold back on capabilities just so someone can use IE7.</p>

<p>MoX uses a number of HTML5 features to make the experience as good as possible:
1. LocalStorage and SessionStorage are used where available for caching server queries. This results in a <strong>significant</strong> reduction in time for common queries - even after closing &amp; reopening the browser. If not enabled then queries are cached in memory so performance is still improved 
2. Web Sockets are used for the JSON-RPC communications where available. In addition to lower overhead for RPC calls, 2-way communication allows for instant notification of events and uber-quick feeback to the Web UI. There is also a fallback to HTTP RPC calls. </p>

<p>Future versions will also incorporate:
1. Responsive design so it will work great on tablets and phones too
2. Playing media directly in the browser using HTML5 on supported browsers (death to Flash!)</p>

<p>The XBMC controller classes have been separated into another project called XbmcControllerJs(<a href="http://denwilliams.github.io/XbmcControllerJs/">http://denwilliams.github.io/XbmcControllerJs/</a>) in the hope that it will assist others in creating more functional Web UIs. Please feel free to use that in whatever project you like.</p>

<p>Utilising a number of AWESOME projects out there:
1. Knockout
2. Bootstrap
3. jQuery
4. Modernizr
5. Noty</p>
